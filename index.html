      Welcome to the show Superman! Tell me, what have you been up to lately?
    </div>
    <div class="chat superman">
      Great to be here Batman! I just got back from stopping a massive earthquake and volcano eruption in the Pacific. Busy as always saving the world! What about you? Been keeping Gotham safe? 
    </div>
    <div class="chat batman">
      Ah yes, business as usual here in Gotham - stopping the Joker and other villains from taking over. I actually just unveiled a new armored batmobile last week to help me fight crime! What do you think of capes these days? Still stylish?
    </div>
    <div class="chat superman">
      Wow, a new batmobile sounds awesome! Capes are definitely still in fashion - though I try to avoid them getting sucked into jet engines when I fly. Have you tried any new gadgets or technology in your fights lately? I'm intrigued by this AI I've heard about...
